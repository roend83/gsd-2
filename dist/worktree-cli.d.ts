/**
 * GSD Worktree CLI — standalone subcommand and -w flag handling.
 *
 * Manages the full worktree lifecycle from the command line:
 *   gsd -w                    Create auto-named worktree, start interactive session
 *   gsd -w my-feature         Create/resume named worktree
 *   gsd worktree list         List worktrees with status
 *   gsd worktree merge [name] Squash-merge a worktree into main
 *   gsd worktree clean        Remove all merged/empty worktrees
 *   gsd worktree remove <n>   Remove a specific worktree
 *
 * On session exit (via session_shutdown event), auto-commits dirty work
 * so nothing is lost. The GSD extension reads GSD_CLI_WORKTREE to know
 * when a session was launched via -w.
 *
 * Note: Extension modules are .ts files loaded via jiti (not compiled to .js).
 * We use createJiti() here because this module is compiled by tsc but imports
 * from resources/extensions/gsd/ which are shipped as raw .ts (#1283).
